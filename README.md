# Codecademy Challenge Project: Credit Card Checker

This project is part of my journey to learn coding, from the Codecademy challenge "Credit Card Checker". The project involves optimizing the verification process for credit cards using functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time.

## Project Overview
The project simulates the role of a clerk who checks the validity of credit cards. The company suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards with invalid numbers. As a clerk, I aim to optimize the verification process using my knowledge of functions and loops.

## Project Goals
The main goals of this project are:

- Implement a function to validate a credit card number.
- Identify and filter out invalid credit cards.
- Determine the issuing company of invalid credit cards.
- Log the status and details of each credit card, such as company, validity, and card number.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js.
4. View the output in the terminal/console to see the status and details of each credit card.
